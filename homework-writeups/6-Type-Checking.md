# Type Checking

This assignment is a chance to practice performing a type proof on your own. Use it as a measuring stick; if you need additional practice, please practice on other classes and methods as you see fit.

Perform a type proof for the `dequeue()` method in the **Queue** class. Submit your type proof as a PDF document.
